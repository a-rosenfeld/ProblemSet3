# Problem Set 3
### Data found at: https://github.com/CompTools/Class_Files/blob/master/data/CO-OPS__8729108__wl.csv
### Metadata found at: https://github.com/CompTools/Class_Files/blob/master/data/CO_OPS__wl_file.md

### Problem 1:
### Write a script (or Jupyter Notebook code block) that opens the file, uses a for loop to read through the file line by line and reports the highest water level and the date and time that was observed.

### Problem 2:
### Write a script (or Jupyter Notebook code block) that reads the file into a Pandas dataframe and reports the highest water level and the date and time that was observed.

### Problem 3:
### Write a script (or Jupyter Notebook code block) that calculates the fastest rise in water level per 6-minute period between measurements (for this assignment, assume that each line of the dataset is a 6-minute interval) and reports the data and time that was observed and the change in water level during that period. You can use line by line or dataframe for this.

### Extra Credit:
### Using the Web Services Button on this page (Links to an external site.) as a guide and/or the API description (Links to an external site.), write a script (or Jupyter Notebook code block) to download data from Panama City, Fl for "today" e.i. whenever the code is run, get that day's data.
